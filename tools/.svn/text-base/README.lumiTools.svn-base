lumiTools
-----------------------------------------------------

There are three scripts. They accept a number of command line
flags. To see them run with --help.

./runLumiTree.py PSET_FILE.py
This will run over the lumiTree for psets in the given PSET_FILE. It
will present the list of psets in the file. Enter a number to choose
one. A JSON file with the same name as the PSet will be output. The
run/ls ranges in here will reflect the CRAB efficiency of the PSet.

./fetchLumi.py [ -o LUMI_INFO_JSON_FILE] JSON_FILE 
This should be run with the most complete JSON we have (i.e. DCS
ONLY). It checks out CMSSW with the lumiCalc script and fetches
recorded/delivered lumi per run/ls for all run/ls in the input JSON
file. This is then stored into the LUMI_INFO_JSON_FILE (by default
x.json -> x.lumiinfo.json). This avoids us having to use the dog slow
lumiCalc script for every single dataset. It works fine at IC.
                                                                                                                                                                      
 
./calcLumi.py JSON_FILE LUMI_INFO_JSON_FILE
This scripts takes a JSON input file, and the complete luminosity dump
from the fetchLumi script and calculates the total recorded/delivered
luminosity.  So for instance use with the output of runLumiTree.py to
calculate the luminosity in a given pset. The script will warn you if
it cant find lumi info for a given run/ls (meaning you need to rerun
fetchLumi with a more recent JSON).
                                                                                                                                                                       
So the procedure would be something like: 
1) ./fetchLumi.py DCS_ONLY.json (only needs to be performed
periodically i.e. with new data)
2) ./runLumiTree.py ../samples/python/data/blah.py 
3) ./calcLumit.py DCS_ONLY.lumiinfo.json PSET_NAME.json
