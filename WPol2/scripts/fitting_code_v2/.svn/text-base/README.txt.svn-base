So, you simply start with :
> root -l run.C

In the main macro roo_fitWH.C , you can find a set of "global" (boolean) variables , at the beginning, which you can enable/disable according to the 
options you want to use . It should be quite straightfoward by the names what these switches do . 

# Electron fits
Execute:
> root -l erun.C

which runs the roo_efitWH.C

# Sim fits
> root -l simrun.C
