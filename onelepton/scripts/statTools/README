Optimisation tools 
----------------------------------- 

The file predict.C contains the main logic of predicting background
and calculating errors. This can be steered via a python (recommended)
or Cint script. The file run.py is an example of a python script to do
it.

./run.py

Limit tool
--------------------------------------
The limit code is in the statTools directory as you say. I'm afraid
during the stress it became quite messy and complicated. The most
important files are:

root_svn.sh - source this first to get the needed version of ROOT

runLimit.py - this is the main script for launching jobs

e.g.  runLimit.py -s -l clsviatoys -p4

will read the ROOT files output by the analysis code and launch batch
jobs (CLS limits, 4 susy grid points per job). It creates output
directories for each job inside a __limit__<timestamp> directory. In
each of these subdirectories, the job.json file tells you the parameters
that went into the fit. The results.json tells you the returned limits
once the jobs is complete.

Once the batch jobs have completed,
> ./runLimit.py -m __limit__... -o mylimit.pkl

will merge all the results.json files together (each containing a
different part of SUSY parameter space) into the file mylimit.pkl. You
can then produce plots from this file by editing and running
plotLimit.py.

To run a single SUSY point locally for testing purposes:

> ./runLimit.py -r -l clsviatoys -N1

likelihood.py
this contains the RooFit implementation of the likelihood
PDF. For the statistics aspect, this is the most important file.

config.py
This contains all the steering variables I use. The most important is
switching between the expected and observed limits, using real data vs
mc pseudodata and setting the systematics included. You can also edit
the names of the ROOT files to read in here.

utils.py, limit_utils.py and runInverter.py
These are various support functions for evaluating the systematics and
running the CLs method.

To get an idea of the statistical procedure, I think its most useful to
look into the files likelihood.py and limit_utils.py. These contains
almost all of the code related directly to the limit. The other files
are mostly for reading in data and dealing with batch jobs (which is
unfortunately necessary due to how long the CLS method takes).
