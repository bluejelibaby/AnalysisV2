Regarding running on the sms, 

*you need to set run_sms as you say. This
fudges the x-section to be 1.0 exactly and thus allows f to be
interpreted as a x-section (instead of a multiple of some nominal
x-section as for mSUGRA). 

*In likelihood.py, you need to change the upper
limit of the f variable to a large number - I used 50 I think. This
allows the x-section to float up as high as it needs to. 

*In utils.py comment out the following:
    #if xs.GetBinContent(xx, yy, zz) < cfg.minXSToConsider: continue
                #if nocuts_noweight.GetBinContent(xx, yy, zz) != 10000:
#                    print "WARNING: Found hole in scan (%d, %d)" % (x,y)
                 #   continue 

*You also need
to comment all of the signal systematics in config.py and I also turned
off the signal contamination (includeSignalContamination =
False). 

*Finally run the limit in profile likelihood mode (pl).
